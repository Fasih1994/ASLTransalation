# Summary and some basic instructions
The meat/most of the code can be found in the `asl_recognition.ipynb` notebook. The `data` directory holds the original data but preprocessed for the `asl_recognition.ipynb` notebook. However, the original data can be found at www.cvssp.org/FingerSpellingKinect2011/fingerspelling5.tar.bz2 or alternatively can be downloaded by running the `data_preprocessing.ipynb` notebook which will first download the images and then proceed to organize and preprocess the data for later.

The capstone's final paper (`American Sign Language Handshape Detection.pdf`) can be found in the `final_paper` directory. The proposal can be found in the `proposal` directory. A zip file `final_submission.zip` has been created for convenience containing both papers.

Other code and resource has been provided in this repo particularly the `evaluation` directory which holds some of the helping code used to finalize some analysis for the final paper. The original benchmark paper can be found at the researcher's website [http://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/people/staff/np331/index.php?section=FingerSpellingDataset](http://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/people/staff/np331/publications/PugeaultBowden2011b.pdf).

Libraries used include pandas, matplotlib, numpy, PIL, seaborn, sklearn, keras, and tensorflow.
