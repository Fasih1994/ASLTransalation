    "> In this section, provide brief details on the background information of the domain from which the project is proposed. Historical information relevant to the project should be included. It should be clear how or why a problem in the domain can or should be solved. Related academic research should be appropriately cited in this section, including why that research is relevant. Additionally, a discussion of your personal motivation for investigating a particular problem in the domain is encouraged but not required.\n",

    "American Sign Language (ASL) is a sign language that does not use speech to communicate and is mostly used by the American Deaf population. Though used throughout the English-speaking United States, it is in fact is it's own language seperate from English and relies on creating the language's syntax with multiple visuals such as handshapes, movement, position, and nonmanual markers. Although there are many variations of sign languages specific to different languages, regions, and needs, being able to use a computer to detect ASL would be extremely useful in not only ASL translation but also other sign language translations as well as just geusture recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "There has been past research in detecting ASL or ASL-like handshapes and movements such as gesture recognition. There have been past attempts in detecting hand motions and handshapes that use datasets with depth information using sensors like the Microsoft Kinnect. However, these technologies are relatively uncommon compared to the ubiquitous  camera sensor found on nearly every computer and phone. The recent advances in image recognition and classification make the concept of detecting and classifying ASL handshapes to be attainable through video or static images (possibly taken from video). "

    "In this project I will classigy static images of different ASL handshapes. This is a good stepping stone before a video dataset is used since time dependence and movement will not have to be considered. My solution could be compared to classifying the MNIST handwritten database but with images of ASL handshapes. If the dataset is already cropped around the handshape, a CNN (possibly taking advantage of transfer learning) could be used to classify the images. The model could then be evaluated with a validation set and/or new images from a similarly preproccessed but independent dataset. "

This dataset contains both colored images and depth sensing data collected from a Microsoft Kinnect. (Note that I will not be using the depth sensing data since my project will be focused on using static images.) The images are in color and include 24 different handshapes each representing a letter from the English alphabet; note \"j\" and \"z\" are excluded since these letters are dependent on movement and those don't have a static image representation. The images have been cropped around the handshape though each cropping results in a differently sized image. The background behind the handshape is not uniform or consistent. The dataset contains 48,0000 images generated by 4 different non-native ASL signers with over 500 samples of each of the 24 different handshapes.\n",
